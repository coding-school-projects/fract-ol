## 📚 About The Project

fract'ol is a 42 School project that renders beautiful mathematical fractals in real-time using the MiniLibX graphics library. This project explores complex number mathematics and computer graphics optimization while creating infinitely zoomable fractal visualizations.

**Key Features:**
- Mandelbrot and Julia set visualizations
- Smooth infinite zoom (mouse wheel)
- Interactive parameter control
- Psychedelic color schemes
- Bonus: Burning Ship fractal, mouse-follow zoom, and color shifting

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coding-school-projects/fractol.git
cd fractol
```

2. Compile the project:
```bash
make
```

3. Run with a fractal type:
```bash
./fractol mandelbrot
./fractol julia -0.7 0.27
./fractol burning_ship  # Bonus
```

### 🎮 Controls
| Key/Mouse | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Mouse Wheel | Zoom in/out |
| ESC | Quit program |
| Arrow Keys | Move view (bonus) |
| C | Cycle color schemes |
| R | Reset view |
| Space | Toggle mouse follow (bonus) |

## 🧠 Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithms
| Fractal | Formula | Implementation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| Mandelbrot | zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + c | Complex plane iteration |
| Julia | zₙ₊₁ = zₙ² + k | Fixed parameter k |
| Burning Ship | zₙ₊₁ = (|Re(zₙ)| + i|Im(zₙ)|)² + c | Absolute value variant |

### Performance Optimizations
- Multi-threaded rendering (4 threads)
- Optimized complex number calculations
- Adaptive iteration counts based on zoom level
- Smooth color gradient interpolation

## 🧪 Testing Protocol

1. Basic rendering test:
```bash
./fractol mandelbrot
```

2. Julia set with parameters:
```bash
./fractol julia -0.4 0.6
```

3. Stress test (deep zoom):
```bash
./fractol mandelbrot
# Zoom 20+ times with mouse wheel
```

4. Bonus features:
```bash
./fractol burning_ship
# Test arrow keys and color cycling
```

## 📝 Evaluation Criteria

1. **Correctness**: Accurate fractal rendering
2. **Performance**: Smooth zooming/panning
3. **Features**: Mandatory + bonus implementations
4. **Code Quality**: No leaks, norm compliant
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful exit on invalid input

### 🧑‍💻 Peer Evaluations (3/3)

> **Peer 1**: "Exceptional fractal implementation! The zoom is buttery smooth even at 20x magnification. The bonus Burning Ship fractal renders perfectly with beautiful color gradients. Code structure is clean and well-organized."

> **Peer 2**: "Most performant fract'ol I've tested. Maintains 60 FPS even during deep zooms. The mouse-follow zoom in the bonus is particularly impressive - it works exactly as expected. Color shifting creates stunning visual effects."

> **Peer 3**: "Perfect score! The attention to mathematical accuracy is remarkable. The Julia set parameters create beautifully distinct patterns. The multi-threaded rendering shows deep understanding of performance optimization. Passed all test cases flawlessly."
